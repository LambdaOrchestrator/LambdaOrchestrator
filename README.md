# Orcha

AWS Lambda Orchestrator. Allows you to give a JSON workflow file written in the Amazon States Language, and execute lambda functions based on your workflow. You can open your workflow in the UI to see a tree diagram of your workflow, run the workflow based on the inputs you specify, and see the diagram update in real-time as your workflow runs on AWS. Executing your workflow requires that you have already created those lambda functions in AWS and have access to them.

## Prerequisites

You need to have access to your lambda functions through the AWS CLI. To test whether you do, run this in your terminal:

```
aws lambda list-functions
```

You should see a list of your lambda functions.

## Installing

Clone the repo and then run:

```
npm install
```

## Creating workflows

The workflow files should be written in the [Amazon States Language](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-amazon-states-language.html).
The only difference between the workflow format and ASL is in the workflow syntax, you specify
a "LambdaToInvoke" (which is just the name of the lambda function) instead of an arn "Resource". 
See test/json_workflow_file_test_cases for example workflow files. These examples are
used by the unit tests in test/orcha.test.js

## Running your workflow

To run your workflow, require the source file, and run executeWorkflow:

```
const orcha = require('./src/orcha);
orcha.executeWorkflow({
    jsonPath,
    workflowObject,
    workflowInput, 
    region, 
    endOfExecutionCallback,
    statusUpdateCallback,
    errorCallback
});
```

Required arguments: workflowInput, region, endOfExecutionCallback, jsonPath OR workflowObject

Optional arguments: statusUpdateCallback, errorCallback

jsonPath is the path to your workflow, workflowInput is the input to your first lambda, region is the AWS region where your lambdas are, endOfExecutionCallback is a function that will run after your workflow is complete, workflowObject is a JSON workflow object that you can pass in instead of passing in the jsonPath argument. 

statusUpdateCallback is a callback function you can specify that will run after a status update in your workflow (such as a lambda function starting or ending). errorCallback is a callback function you can specify that will run if your workflow fails. Both statusUpdateCallback and errorCallback are optional, but recommended.

An example of how you could run a workflow and log the result to the console:

```
orcha.executeWorkflow({
    jsonPath: 'test.json', 
    workflowInput: {users: ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']}, 
    region: 'us-east-1', 
    endOfExecutionCallback: (workflowOutput) => console.log(workflowOutput)
});
```

## Using the Application

To run the UI first build the React application:

```
npm run bundle
```

Then run the application:

```
npm run serve
```

You can then open a workflow file (Ctrl+O) to view the workflow tree. To run your workflow, enter a JSON object input into the input panel, and run your workflow by entering Ctrl+R.
You will see the lambda states change color as they are invoked and return from completion on AWS.

## Running the tests

To run the unit tests:

```
npm test
```
